<h5>Hi! I'm Sarah,</h5>

<p>I teach people how to do UX. (No design degree required!)</p>

<p>If you want to make products that look and feel good, check out my class in the SF Bay Area: [UX Design
for Engineers](http://www.uxdesignforengineers.com).</p>

<p>If you're not ready for that kind of commitment, my UX newsletter is a great way to get 
better at UX from the comfort of your couch!</p>
